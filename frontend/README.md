To Do -
Do I need to add a footer?
CreateProfile Component - should I put useState Consts into one object and update with spread operators etc.

CreateProfile Component - axios response, should it check for successful upload through the response object

CreateProfile Component / Login Page - should add something that will reflect the fact that someone has just logged in - maybe pass their email address through to the username input?

Need to adjust the create blog to do an edit blog as well. Need to pass a props.type in and then do a seperate axios response, i feel that another axios response is the only way to keep it from being too messy

Need to add in a delete blog functionality as well. That will hit the delete blog endpoint - then on response will simply refresh to page(just navigate to the same page - not sure if thats possible but need to figure a way to re-render)
